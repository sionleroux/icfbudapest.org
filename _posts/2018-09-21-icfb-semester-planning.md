In case you missed this funFriday, here's a summary of what we shared, discussed, ideas we came up with, decisions we made, etc.

First we talked a little bit about what ICFB is, and why it's been so special to so many people.

- hospitality
- commitment
- openness
- home
- family
- love
- spontaneity
- fun

We shared our funny stories about pets. Mostly about cats. That fly. Or jump.

## Some technical things:

- we have a Slack chat where we discuss everything, e.g. Friday meetings, retreat organizing. If you want to be there, let us know, and we'll send you an invite.
- we also have a Trello board for ideas, organizing. You can join that too!

## Meeting place:

We used to have a constant meeting place, but we have decided to meet in our homes instead. It's more cosy & comfy. If you would like to host ICFB once in a while, you are more than welcome to do so! Let us know!

## Starting time:

Our Friday meetings officially start at 6 p.m. We love chatting, but in order to have ample time for the things we planned, we have agreed to be a bit more strict and actually start the worship - Bible study - discussion - prayer part at around 6.30 p.m. So please keep this in mind and try to be punctual. (If, for some reason, you can arrive only later, no worries! Come and join!)

We want to make sure we start every Friday fellowship with _prayer_, bringing the evening before God. We believe he blesses us. And we want to devote time to prayer in the end, as well. So you are always welcome to bring your prayer requests!

## Bible study:

This semester we are going to continue _the Apostle Paul_ series. We had the first part of it a year ago, and this semester comes the second part. There are 7 weeks left, so we are going to have Fridays for other topics as well.

If you would like to take part in ICFB by leading Bible studies, discussions, let us know!

## Worship:

If you feel called to lead us in worship, then come and do so!

Or course volunteering doesn't mean a commitment for every single Friday. If you can do it only once in a while, that's also good!

Last but definitely not least, we appreciate a lot if you pray for ICFB. For God's guidance, wisdom, for vision, so that we could be what God wants us to be, going wherever he leads.

THANK YOU:)
